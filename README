NAME: Ragheb Saad Barheyan
UCID Number: 10090103
Tutorial Section: T01

=== 1. EXECUTION: ===

To compile the program, on the terminal enter the following commands:

        qmake -project QT+=widgets QT+=network
        qmake
	make

To run the program, on the terminal enter the following command:

        ./A1

=== 2. PROGRAM USE: ===

Menu items:
-Here is description of Menus and the items inside them, note the each item will have a letter in bracket which is the shortcut key for that item
    File menu:
        New Game(N): This will create a new game, and if your already playing it will reset to new game
        Reset(R): This will reset your view to default
        Quit(Q): This will quit the application

    Draw menu:
        Wireframe(W): This will change the drawing mode to wireframe, where the edges are only drawn
        Face(F): This will change the drawing mode to filled. Each block will have it's own color in this mode
        Multicolored(M): This will change the drawing mode to multicolored. Each block will have 6 different colors for each face of the cube constructing them. No two tetris block will share a face color.

    Game menu:
        Pause(P): This will pause/unpause your game.
        Speed Up(PgUp): This will increase the speed in which the tetris blocks are falling to a minimum of 50 ms (Note the game default speed is 500ms)
        Slow Down (PgDown): This will decrease the speed in which the tetris blocks are falling to a maximum of 2000ms
        Auto-Increase(A): This will automatically increase the speed in which the tetris blocks are falling every 5 seconds

    Network - Prototype:
        Host(H): This will establish a TCP server to host a game
        Gues(G): This will attempt to connect to a TCP server to join a game

Gameplay Control:
    Left Arrow: This will move the tetris block left
    Right Arrow: This will move the tetris block right
    Up Arrow: This will rotate the tetris block counter clockwise
    Down Arrow: This will rotate the tetris block clockwise
    Spacebar: This will instantly drop the tetris block
    Backspace: This will increase the speed in which tetris block is falling (Better version of the Drop block feature)

View Control:
    Left Mouse Click and Drag: Left Clicking and dragging will rotate the view around the x Axis
    Middle Mouse Click and Drag: Middle Clicking and dragging will rotate the view around the y Axis
    Right Mouse Click and Drag: Right clicking and dragging will rotate the view around the z Axis
    ****Note that if you realsed the mouse button while moving, the persistence rotation will start.

    Shift + Any Mouse Button and Drag: This will zoom out when dragging left, and in when draging right
    ****Note releasing the shift key while still holding the mouse click will not switch to rotating.

Network Interaction(Prototype):
****Note that this is a prototype, and there is a couple workflows that needs to be handled (will be mentioned in the known bugs section)
    Steps to establish Multiplayer:
        1- Launch an instance of the app
        2- Click on the Network menu and choose Host (or alternatively press H), Check your terminal and Check for "Server started!"
        3- Launch another instance of the app
        4- Click on the Network menu and this time choose Guest (or alternatively press G)
        5- If successful in both instances it will add a mini renderer(small game window) and add it to below the main game running
****The server and the client will only transmit the board state to each other, so basically in the app mini renderer will be an exact copy of whatever is happenning in the other instance of the app.

*******Known Network Bugs********
    Crashing:
        1- Workflow (1)
            a- If you run your the first instance and click on Guest(G)
            b- Run the second instance and click on Host(H)
            c- Go back to the first instance and click on Gues(G)  ====> This will cause the instace to crash
    Messing features:
        a- There is no way to close the server or close the connection from the client
        b- If there is a multiplayer going, and one of the app instances is closed, the instance will not throw away the mini renderer. and instead it will be there in "pause mode"
        c- No way of telling which player won, because the network is only a copy paste of the game state in the other instance


== 3. ALGORITHMS and DESIGN DECISIONS: ===
generateUniqueRandomColor()
Generate multiple color genrate three list of length 256, each one represent a color channel.
Then it constructs 42 color list by takning a random red index, removing it from the red channel list. the same also applies for green and blue.
The removing part gaurentees that there will be 42 different colors.
We choose 42 colors because there is 7 types of cubes (7 from tetris blocks)  each containing 6 faces (6 * 7 = 42).

SetMultipleColors(int id)
Takes a block id. The starting index for a block with id is id * 6.
then we will pick the color for our 42 color list and for pick a color for a face, then increment (id * 6) by one for the next face and so on
****Note that the border
example for id 0
First face color index 0
Second face color index 1
...
Sixth face color index 5

example for id 6
First face color index 36
Second face color index 37
...
Sixth face color index 41


Drawing the Game State:
I had to make a decision here where I have to copy the game state from the Game into a local QList<int>gameBoardState in renderer.
The drawing will happen on gameBoardState instead of m_game->get(r, c). The reason I did so that network playing works. and having the ability to set gameStateBoard outside the renderer class is important for Network playing where we send the game state

Network:
    Sending Direction-
        Each time the gameBoardState changes get a copy of it send it to the server or the client
    Recieving Direction-
        Each time we recieve gameBoardState, call m_secondRenderer->SetGameState(recieved gameBoardState) and in that function there is an update.

=== 5. PROGRAM ASSUMPTIONS: ===

Since the network works on localhost, it should also work anywhere else if I changed where the TCPserver is runnning without need to make any further modification
